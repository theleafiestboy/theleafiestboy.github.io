        <h1> Useful Resources </h1>
        <p> Following is a list of useful sources and links encompassing a diverse range of topics that I've stumbled across 
            foraging through the internet. For free-to-read material, you'll find links to the relevant destination.
            For copyrighted material, I've put in full citations, and I trust that people will be able to 'procure' them from elsewhere :D 
            I'm making this mostly because it's cumbersome to sync all resources across devices, accounts, and sites; and 
            it's equally cumbersome to share resources to different sets of potentially interested people 
            through different channels of communication. The material here includes books/articles, reddit posts, interesting 
            playlists, and a bunch of other stuff. Since a big part of why I made this page was for my own convenience, 
            I sometimes use my own abbreviations and references without full explanation. It goes without saying that I take no responsibility for any content on the links you'll be 
            directed to. </p>
